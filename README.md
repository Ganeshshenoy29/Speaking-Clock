The Speaking Clock is a Spring Boot microservice designed to convert a given time in 24-hour format into its corresponding English words. The service offers two main features: converting the current system time into words and allowing users to input a specific time for conversion. For instance, the service will transform "13:45" into "It's one forty-five" and recognize special cases like "Midnight" for "00:00" and "Midday" for "12:00." Robust exception handling ensures that users receive clear error messages if they input a time in an incorrect format. 

The project is structured with a main application class (`SpeakingClockApplication.java`) that initializes the service, a controller (`TimeController.java`) that manages HTTP requests, and a service class (`TimeToWordsService.java`) that contains the logic for time conversion. Custom exceptions and a global exception handler ensure that errors are managed effectively. The project also includes comprehensive unit tests to verify the accuracy of the time conversion logic. 

Additionally, the service is integrated with Swagger for interactive API documentation, making it easy for users to explore and test the available endpoints. The project uses Spring Boot for building the microservice, Maven for dependency management, and Java 8 as the core programming language. Unit tests are written using JUnit, and SpringFox is used for Swagger integration. Overall, the Speaking Clock project is a demonstration of how to build a RESTful microservice with clear, maintainable code, proper documentation, and robust exception handling.
